# VideoCompressor
A High-performance video compressor for Android using Hardware decoding and encoding API(MediaCodec).

## Demo
![Demo](/pic/Demo.gif)

## Usage
```


import numan.dev.videocompressor.VideoCompressTask;
import numan.dev.videocompressor.VideoCompressor;

  /**
   * @param srcPath     string, filepath of source file
   * @param destPath    string, ouput filepath
   * @param outputWidth  pixels, output video width
   * @param outputHeight pixels, output video height
   * @param bitrate  int, in bits per second
   * @param listener  the listenr of convert progress
   */
VideoCompressTask task = VideoCompressor.convertVideo(srcPath, destPath, 200, 360, 200 * 360 * 30, new new VideoCompressor.ProgressListener() {
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        //Start Compress
    }

    @Override
    public void onFinish() {
        //Finish successfully
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(String errorMessage) {
        promise.resolve(srcPath);
    }

    @Override
    public void onProgress(float percent) {
        //Progress
    }
});

// for cancel compression
task.cancel(true);
```

## Performance
You can find some test results in pic/test_reports.

I compress a video which is 168MB(00:01:06). 

And it took 1 minute for compressing.

The result of compressing is 11MB. 

So it's a great job by MediaCodec :) .
